To run the N_Queens program, use "make run".

Once the program starts, the terminal will be cleared, and users will be asked to input a number (N) that is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 20.

As long as the user submitted a valid input, the program will arrange the queens in an order where there is no conflict between any of them.

Each queen's location will be displayed through a list of coordinates as well as a visualization of the chess board. Every spot where a queen is located is represented through a Q, and a * will otherwise represent an empty spot.
